# SWAP
SWAP is a front-end focused project built in **Vue 3** designed for **students** and **course directors** to manage academic schedules more efficiently.

Students can:

- View their schedules.

- Request to swap shifts with classmates.

Course directors have access to a management dashboard where they can:

- Oversee and manage all shifts.

- Approve or reject shift swap requests.

- Modify classroom allocations.

- View student schedules and shift distributions.

This project offers a user-friendly interface for academic scheduling and communication between students and administration.

While SWAP is primarily a front-end application, it includes:
- A **mock backend** powered by **json-server**, used for local testing and development..
- Some real backend logic implemented with **TypeScript**, allowing dynamic behavior in selected routes and features.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
